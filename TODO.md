# Unsolved problems and nuasances aka TODO list.

* Refactor CRS validation.
* Refactor CRS migration.
* Split gjl.Error.throwError into multiple, typed subclasses.
* Create a diagnostic tool by collecting every error, and throwing them at once.
* Make validating functions consistent.
* Add support for creating random holes in random polygons (PIP algorithm needed).
* Add support for creating random multipart features.
* Implement pretty print.
* Integrate a linter into the development process.
* Optimize to ES2015, if the browser support becomes adequate. Maybe an ES2015 fork/branch to maintain backward compability?
